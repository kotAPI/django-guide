## History 

Alright, some history of Django- In summer 2005, after having developed this framework to a point where it was efficiently powering most of World Onlineâ€™s sites, the World Online team, which now included Jacob Kaplan-Moss, decided to release the framework as open source software. They released it in July 2005 and named it Django, after the jazz guitarist Django Reinhardt.(thedjangobook.com)
